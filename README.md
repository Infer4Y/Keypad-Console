# Keypad-Console
The source code to my projectOn hackaday : https://hackaday.io/project/171302-keypad-console

Future plans are to make a game engine for this device to use. The device has an i2c output to hook up more devices.

Problems currently faced by the device is the 1.8" tft display which has an area of noise. The lower half does not update correct.
